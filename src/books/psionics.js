	text : `	Psionics are a form of supernatural power that affect the mind. <br>
	Psionics and arcana are crucially distinct. To put it simply, psionics affect the mind while arcana affects physical objects. To put it less simply, while arcana is a manipulation of the discrepancy between real-space and imaginary-space, psionics is a manipulation of imaginary-space itself using 6real-space as a partial conduit. <br>
	Psionics are generally divided into three subcategories: Reading, Sensory, Autopsi, and Control. <br>
	Reading is the impact of other minds on the user's mind. The user can essentially "read minds", gaining insight on another's mental state in various ways. <br>
	Sensory is the impact of other times and places on the user's mind. The user can capture glimpses of the future and see in other places. <br>
	Autopsi is the impact of the user's mind on itself. The user can make themselves stronger mentally. <br>
	Control is the impact of the user's mind on other's minds. It allows all forms of control from confusion to hypnotism. <br>
	Because many fear their potential uses, psionics are heavily restricted and regulated or even illegal in much of the world.`

	text : `	One of the easiest and simplest uses of psionics is mind reading. From knowing a person's name before they tell you, to finding out how they feel about you, to unlocking their deepest, darkest secrets, reading is an essential and useful skill for any psion. <br>
	Basic reading is completely safe for the prying psion. It is impossible for the target to recognize reading being used against them, however aware they may be. Reading simply does not have even the slightest impact on the target's mind that they could use to recognize the attempt. However, it is not difficult for an individual versed in psionics to passively block any attempts at reading. <br> 
	If one wishes to read another's mind when that other knows how to block reading, one can try to Probe. This is a risky business; due to its intrusive nature, the target may be able to recognize it. It's possible that anyone able to block reading would also be able to recognize the probing.`
